        <p>tech involves many thing and in IITBombay then first tech event we took part was xlr8 in which we have to make bot car which can perform some specific work and clear some obstacles.though the competition in this event was a lot because almost every freshie was in this event we still managed to get best design award because of unique design of our bot that design was mainly suggested by one of our team member pavit pal.  if you want to know more about our design and bot click the link below in red color<span > <a href ="https://github.com/Hemang-Dave/Blackjack/tree/main/JOKER"style="color:red">click here</a></span></p>

          In the team photo, I, Ujjwal, am on the left, accompanied by Pavit (our Paaji), Vinay in the green T-shirt, and Hemang capturing the moment. The competition, while immensely enjoyable, proved to be a challenging endeavor, demanding 2 to 3 sleepless nights. Engaging in such competitions not only enhances practical knowledge but also fosters a collaborative spirit within the team. The shared experience of navigating the challenges adds a dynamic element to the learning process, making it both enriching and memorable </p>

          The second tech event I participated in at my institute to develop my hobby was a RC Plane competition. In this competition, our team consisted of me (Ujjwal), Pavit, Hemang, and Vinay, the same team as XLR8. We adopted a unique design approach, creating a bat-shaped plane with a high wing span and area for enhanced flight stability and control. The uni-body design aimed at minimizing damage in case of crashes, and despite experiencing 3 to 4 crashes, the damage remained minimal. Our innovative design and successful execution showcase our team's creativity and problem-solving skills in the competition. </p>

      <p>
        Our team won the Best Design Award in the event, and it was a lot of fun, except for a few times when I accidentally crashed the plane I was controlling. Because of this event, I learned a bunch about how planes are built and how they fly. It was like a mix of having a good time and getting to know cool stuff about planes. well the one in video flying the plane was our mentor not meðŸ™‚
